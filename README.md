To run the application, switch into the 'application-contents' folder and run the 'driver.py' file using Python 3. 

This application requires the 'tkinter' and 'sqlite3' Python modules to run properly.

The 'EduCycle Database User Guide.pdf' file contains all of the information necessary for interacting with the application. In addition, a schema is provided which outlines the database design.
